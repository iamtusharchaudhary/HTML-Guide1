# HTML Form Tag And Attribute

### A form is a container that allows users to input data and submit it to a server for processing. Forms provide a way to interact with users, collect information, and send it to a server for further processing, such as submitting a registration form, making a purchase, or conducting a search.

# Form Tag
```
<form method="post" action="page-name">
</form>
```

# Input Tag
### The < input > tag is used to create various types of form controls or input fields that allow users to enter data. The < input > tag is a self-closing tag, meaning it does not require a closing tag. Here are some commonly used attributes with the < input > tag:
```
[ type ] : Specifies the type of input control to be created. Some common values for the type attribute are:
[ name ] : Specifies the name of the input field. The name is used to identify the input field when the form is submitted.
[ value ] : Sets the initial value of the input field. This attribute is used to pre-fill the input with a default value.
[ placeholder ] : Provides a hint or example text that is displayed in the input field before the user enters any value.
[ required ] : Specifies that the input field is required and must be filled in before the form can be submitted.
```
