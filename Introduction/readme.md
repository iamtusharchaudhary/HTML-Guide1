# HTML Introduction
### HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a markup language used to create web pages. HTML consists of different elements, tags, and attributes that define the structure and content of the web page.

# HTML Tag (Elements)
### A tag is a container that encloses text, images, and other elements to define their meaning and structure. HTML tags are used to format and structure content on the web page. For example, the < p> tag is used to define a paragraph, and the < h1> tag is used to define a heading.
```
<h1>This is HTML heading one</h1>
<h2>This is HTML heading two</h2>
<h3>This is HTML heading three</h3>
<h4>This is HTML heading four</h4>
<h5>This is HTML heading five</h5>
<h6>This is HTML heading six</h6>
<h7>This is not a heading its default paragraph.</h7>
```


# HTML Attribute
### An attribute is a property of an HTML element that provides additional information about the element. Attributes are used to modify the behavior, appearance, or functionality of an HTML element. For example, the "href" attribute is used in the tag to specify the destination of the hyperlink. The "src" attribute is used in the  tag to specify the source of the image.

<h5>This is HTML heading five</h5>
<h6>This is HTML heading six</h6>
<h7>This is not a heading . its default paragraph.</h7>
```

# Paragraph Tag
### The < p > element is used to define a paragraph of text. It represents a block of text or content that is typically separated from adjacent paragraphs by vertical spacing.
```
<p>the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.</p>
<p>the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.</p>
<p>the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.</p>
<p>the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.</p>
